The latest in my series of drone cinematography videos.  After getting some feedback on the length of the previous video, I decided to make this one a bit shorter.  This was all filmed at my parents' house on a foggy day in Pennsylvania.  The video is set to the song A-O-K by Tai Verdes.  Enjoy the show!
