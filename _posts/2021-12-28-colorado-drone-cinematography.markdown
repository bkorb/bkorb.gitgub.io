After getting a taste of drone cinematography by making the video in my [Boulder Drone Cinematography]({% post_url 2021-12-28-boulder-drone-cinematography %}) post, I knew I had to make another.  I captured and edited this footage of the Rockies and the Flatirons from a bit higher up Flagstaff road as well as a location by NCAR, the National Center for Atmospheric Research.  The video is set to the song Colorado by Milky Chance.  Enjoy the show!
