Hello!  My name is Brandon Korb, that's me in the banner of this page.  I'm a data scientist/computer scientist/physicist currently working as a data scientist for Booz Allen Hamilton and pursuing a computer science PhD at William & Mary.  I graduated from the University of Colorado, Boulder in December of 2021 with a bachelors in Physics and Mathematics, and earned a master's degree in physics from William & Mary in 2023.  My interests shift pretty rapidly, but over the past few years I've spent time exploring things such as:
 - Artificial Intellegence
 - Computer Vision
 - Numerical Simulation
 - Racing Drones
 - [Cinematography](/tags/#cinematography)
 - Video Editing
 - Electronics
 - Terrariums
 - Mountain Biking
 - Bikepacking
 - Bike Maintenance
 - Skiing
 - Bouldering
 - Soccer
 - Photography
 - Language Learning

I'm always looking for new things to try and new people to do things with, so feel free to reach out if you're interested in any of these topics as well.

On this site, I'll post short articles about the projects I'm working on in my free time. Whether you're here to explore or to review my portfolio, I hope you enjoy your stay!  My intended layout for this site is to post semi-frequent updates on my ongoing projects and other short things under posts with a blog-like format.  I will post longer, more detailed descriptions of my projects and adventures under their respective pages with an article-like format.
